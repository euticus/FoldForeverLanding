# ProteinApp Landing Page - Refactored

This is a refactored version of the ProteinApp landing page built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🏗️ Refactoring Improvements

### 1. **Component Organization**
- Separated concerns into individual, reusable components
- Each section is now its own component with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Components are exported from a central `components/index.ts` file

### 2. **File Structure**
```
FoldForeverLanding/
├── components/
│   ├── HeroSection.tsx
│   ├── HowItWorksSection.tsx
│   ├── FeaturesSection.tsx
│   ├── UseCasesSection.tsx
│   ├── PricingSection.tsx
│   ├── Footer.tsx
│   ├── types.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── hooks/
│   └── useLandingPageHandlers.ts
├── lib/
│   ├── constants.ts
│   └── utils.ts
└── pages/
    └── index.tsx
```

### 3. **TypeScript Integration**
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Type-safe component props and event handlers
- Global type declarations for external libraries (Google Analytics)

### 4. **Data Management**
- Extracted all content data to `lib/constants.ts`
- Easy to maintain and update content without touching components
- Centralized configuration management

### 5. **Custom Hooks**
- Created `useLandingPageHandlers` for managing user interactions
- Includes analytics tracking setup
- Separation of business logic from UI components

### 6. **Improved User Experience**
- Added transition effects and hover states
- Better visual hierarchy with consistent spacing
- Enhanced accessibility with proper semantic HTML

### 7. **Maintainability**
- Each component is self-contained and testable
- Easy to add new sections or modify existing ones
- Clear separation between data, logic, and presentation
